                        <li><b><i>Ninjutsu (忍術)</li></i></b>  
                             <p>Sometimes used interchangeably with the modern term ninpō (忍法),[1] is the martial art strategy and tactics of unconventional warfare, guerrilla warfare and espionage purportedly practised by the ninja.[2][page needed] Ninjutsu was a separate discipline in some traditional Japanese schools, which integrated study of more conventional martial arts (taijutsu) along with shurikenjutsu, kenjutsu, sōjutsu, bōjutsu and others. </p>

                        <li><b><i>Modern Ninjutsu (忍術) </li></i></b> 
                            <p>When it comes to modern ninjutsu schools, there are four reputable organisations that can be traced to Japan: Organisations that teach martial arts and ninjutsu transmitted by Toshitsugu Takamatsu (i.e. Bujinkan, Jinenkan and Genbukan) and Banke Shinobinoden. While none can prove their lineages back to the Sengoku or Edo period, their founders are deeply involved in ninjutsu research.
                            For this exploration, I emailed Eric Shahan from Jinenkan and a representative at Banke Shinobinoden Spain. Keep in mind that this is purely speculative and digs into the experiences of people within their respective arts.</p>
